# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This application was built to give a test on the basics of JavaScript. Users can
click through the answers and receive a score based on how much time they took and
how many questions they got right.

## Installation

Either go to https://zoellaphine.github.io/JS-Quiz/ or clone the repository and open 
index.html in a browser.

## Usage

Simply press the Start Quiz button and it will bring the user to the first question.
After answering all of the questions you can view your score and enter your initials.
Entering your initials, along with the View Scores button, unfortunately does not serve
any practical functionality at this time and is a direction for future development.
To restart the quiz just refresh the page.
